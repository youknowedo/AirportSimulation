# Airport simulation
An airport simulator made for the Programmering 2 class in GÃ¶teborgsregionens Tekniska Gymnasium. Takes an input of the amount of intervals that you want to simulate and simulates them while giving you statistics. An excel sheet is also opened where you can see what happened during each interval.

- Get the code:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/youknowedo/AirportSimulation.git
